# Hi, I'm Sam ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
ðŸŒ± I'm a junior Python developer with a passion for solving complex problems and a continuous learning mindset. I started my journey into programming a few months ago and have since been immersing myself in Python, focusing on areas like web scraping, data analysis, and bot creation. 

Although I'm relatively new to the field, I am highly committed to improving my skills and mastering best practices in coding. I'm currently seeking opportunities to apply what I've learned and contribute to interesting projects.

## What I'm Currently Working On

- Developing a web scraper bot that delivers updates through Telegram
- Improving my understanding of Python libraries, like Pandas, Numpy, and aiogram
- Learning more about web development with Django and Flask

## Contact Me

I believe in the power of community and the sharing of knowledge, so feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on a project, need help with something I've worked on, or just want to chat about programming.
